* Page 1: index.html All looks good here on all mid and large screens. The only thing I would recommend in this page is adding the hamburger for the nav menu. So when it reaches the mobile it has those three lines. Search hamburger menu for Nav bar.
* Page 2: About.html Looks good as well, again only recommendation is adding the hamburger menu when on mobile size.
 * Page: 3 Menu.html text looks larger than on the prototype please fix text size. Also I can't click on any of the menu links. Links are broken please fix. Also footer is not responsive, text bleeds into cards. please fix.
* Page: 4 Page looks ok in large size. but other sizes are not responsive please fix responsiveness. Also nav hamburger and link on nave bar are broken. I can get to any other pages. please fix.
* Page: 5 looks great. Fully responsive. Again just add hamburger menu on mobile sizes. Also links on nav are broken please fix. Make sure Nav menu looks the same across all pages, same with footer.

Over all looks good just those minor fixes.
